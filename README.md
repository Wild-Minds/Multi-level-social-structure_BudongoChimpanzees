# Multi-level-social-structure_BudongoChimpanzees
We describe the flexibility in social organisation of two wild chimpanzee communities in Budongo Uganda.

Individuals may vary their sociality in response to variation in their socio-ecological landscape allowing them to maximise the benefits of social living for individual fitness in different ways at different times ([Kummer, 1968](https://www.karger.com/Book/Home/217195); Langman, 1977; [Couzin, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982206011924); [Aureli et al., 2008](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/586708?casa_token=O1I5PFDumYwAAAAA%3A0_M8_w3-dh_kscqw_OimJCyGoHpP8auCH_eHY5pN6NYyrQb5O10E8z9xLiRulXb4rLW31MJOy4p3Cw)). Fission-fusion sociality provides one example; here individuals within a single social group vary the number and composition of their immediate associates (or party) across the day, by joining or splitting from other individuals within their social group. Multilevel social organisation offers an additional layer of structured flexibility, with core units who maintain reliable cohesion, nested within a larger social grouping. While both forms of sociality are widespread in primates (e.g. [Patzelt et al., 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/41/14740.short); [Bowler et al., 2012](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10764-012-9603-6.pdf); [Forcina et al., 2019](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.2019); [Nishida, 1968](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01730971); [Amici, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208010968)), and some mammal species show a combination of them (Miller et al., 2010; [VanderWaal et al., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/25/1/17/221766)), the integration of multilevel social structure with fission-fusion sociality has rarely been reported in nonhuman primate species, and has been suggested to be a key point of distinction in the evolution of human social organisation ([Grueter et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534720301336)).

We test the hypothesis that fission-fusion chimpanzee communities with many males benefit from an additional level of social organisation in a large group of chimpanzees, the Waibira community of the Budongo Forest Uganda, who have an estimated 120 individuals and 24-31 independent males. We compare the social organisation of this community to that of their neighbouring community, Sonso, who present a more typical East African chimpanzee demography with around 65-70 individuals, and 10-13 males. We contrast the level of cohesion and sub-grouping within both networks and explore the impact of social grouping on ranging behaviour in Waibira males.
